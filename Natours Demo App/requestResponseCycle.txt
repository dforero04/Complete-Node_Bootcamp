Middleware = everything that happens in between the request and the response
- All the middleware in an app is called the Middleware Stack
- Ordered as defined in the codebase
- Req/Res objects are passed to each piece of middleware
- - A next() is called to pass the req/res object to the next piece of middleware
- - - Done behind the scenes
- Request - Response Cycle is complete when you send the complete response
